No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Said, said
Said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I seh
And, no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Said, said
Said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was logwood burnin' through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone, I mean
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
I said, everything's gonna be all right-a!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, now!
Everything's gonna be all right!
So woman, no cry
No, no woman
No woman, no cry
Woman, little sister
Don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was logwood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Woman, little darlin', say don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Eh! Little darlin', don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
