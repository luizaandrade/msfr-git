Pray, hey, you are a working boy in New York City
You took the train to liberate your body
And liberate your heart, you are trying to find a home soon
Always the saddest when a friend can't make it
Love everyone along the way
You never had a chance to tell them
What you would like to do
If the love permits you
Everybody gets an even shot at making heaven
Wide is the gate
Everybody gets an even shot at making heaven
Wide is the gate
Pray, gay, you are the holy boy outside the scriptures
Far and away from all the brightest sunbeams
You choose to stay and fight from the inside outside
Don't fight, make like the cutest owl and use your feathers
Make like the elephant and use your memory to pick a path
Make like the sleeping bird dreaming of the morning
Everybody gets an even shot at seeing heaven
Wide is the gate
Everybody gets an even shot at seeing heaven
Wide is the gate
Pray, hey, God doesn't care about the way you're leaning
Once you are happy and you know yourself
Peace can come in your heart, you can make a new start
One day, we will be justified without the struggle
We will be recognized for what we do
Not criticized or hated just for the way you are
You will be a star
So listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Singing to the hope inside you
Listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Singing to the hope
Everybody gets an even shot at making heaven (everybody gets a shot)
Wide is the gate (everybody gets a shot)
Everybody gets an even shot at making heaven (everybody gets a shot)
Wide is the gate (everybody gets a shot)
